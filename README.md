# team-profile-generator

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles


Team profile/roster can be created by first running 'npm install'. Questions about employees/team members will be prmopted by running 'node ap.js'
Simply answer the questions and wait for the html page to populate with your Dream Team's info!
